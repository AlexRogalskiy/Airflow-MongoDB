Step 1: Set up your environment

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
Step 2: Install Apache Airflow

Run the following command to install Apache Airflow:
```
pip install apache-airflow
```
Step 3: Initialize the Airflow database

Initialize the Airflow database by running the following command:
```
airflow db init
```
Step 4: Configure Airflow

Open the Airflow configuration file airflow.cfg in a text editor.
Locate the [core] section and set the executor parameter to LocalExecutor.
In the [mongodb] section, configure the MongoDB connection settings, including host, port, schema, user, and password.

Step 5: Create a DAG file

In your project directory, create a new file with a .py extension, such as my_dag.py.

Open the file in a text editor and import the necessary modules:
```
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from pymongo import MongoClient
```

Define a Python function that represents your task. This function will be executed when the DAG is triggered:
```
def my_task():
    # Connect to MongoDB
    client = MongoClient('mongodb://your_mongodb_host:your_mongodb_port')
    db = client.your_database
    collection = db.your_collection
    
    # Perform operations on the MongoDB data
    # Example: Fetch documents from the collection
    documents = collection.find({})
    for document in documents:
        print(document)
Create a DAG object and define its parameters:
with DAG(
    dag_id='my_dag',
    schedule_interval=None,  # Set the schedule as per your requirement
    start_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 29),  # Set the start date
) as dag:
```
Define a task using the PythonOperator and pass the previously defined function as the python_callable parameter:
my_task_operator = PythonOperator(
    task_id='my_task',
    python_callable=my_task
)
Set up the dependencies between tasks, if any:
my_task_operator
```
Save the DAG file.

Step 6: Start the Airflow scheduler and web server

Open a new terminal window.

Run the following command to start the Airflow scheduler:
```
airflow scheduler
```
Run the following command to start the Airflow web server:
```
airflow webserver
```
Step 7: Access the Airflow UI

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the URL specified by Airflow).
You should see the Airflow UI, where you can monitor and manage your DAGs.

That's it! You've deployed Apache Airflow and configured it to use MongoDB as a data source. Your DAG (my_dag.py) will be available in the Airflow UI, and you can trigger it manually or set up a schedule according to your needs.
